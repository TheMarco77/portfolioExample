# Just another portfolio example.

- For this portfolio example you will find that the technologies that I'm using
  are HTML and CSS to complete this project. I'm also using Github pages to host
  it.

* [x] **Home page story:** Listed I have a sample of my **Background** and my
      **Goals** displayed in the form of card style, they both will highlight to
      blue on the bottom of the card when hovering with mouse, my bobble head
      will zoom out when hovered as well and displaying my current social media
      platforms I used to network.

* [x] **Experience Tab:** Same as the **home page tab** however you will only
      find one card.

* [x] **Project save the Honey Bees:** The portfolio image is my wife's hand
      holding a working bee that landed in a strange position, the picture was
      taken I used **CSS** to spin the picture so you can see it like it's
      straight. You will also find a few pictures of us enjoying the humble
      presence of our working lady bees.

If you read it this far. Thank you! For stopping by and checking this project.
